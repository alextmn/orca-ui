## Logo

The ORQA logo consists of a geometric shape with a clean, modern aesthetic. The logo should always be displayed with appropriate spacing and should not be modified or distorted.

## Design Principles

### Collisionless Design
The design follows a "collisionless" approach, emphasizing clean layouts with proper spacing between elements. This creates a sense of calm and order in the interface.

### Whitespace
Generous use of whitespace is essential to the brand identity, allowing content to breathe and creating a premium feel.

### Typography Hierarchy
Clear typographic hierarchy helps guide users through the interface, with distinct styles for headings, subheadings, and body text.
